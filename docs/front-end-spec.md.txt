Version: 1.0
Reference: docs/prd.md, SkillCert_LandingPage.markdown, SkillCert_PRD.markdown

1. Overview

This UI/UX specification outlines the design for SkillCert, a decentralized web app for earning, verifying, and showcasing blockchain-verified micro-credentials. The interface prioritizes a futuristic aesthetic with glassmorphism, neumorphism, micro-interactions, 3D elements, and aurora gradients to engage freelancers, educators, employers, and tech recruiters in the $400B gig economy. The design ensures accessibility (WCAG 2.1), performance (page load <1s), and portfolio appeal for 2025 tech roles.

Purpose





Deliver an intuitive, visually stunning interface that enhances user engagement and showcases modern UI trends (React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui).



Support key user flows: task submission, credential issuance, verification, and progress tracking.



Highlight Web3 integration (blockchain, IPFS) through 3D visuals and micro-interactions.

Target Audience





Freelancers: Intuitive forms and dashboards to earn and share credentials.



Educators: Streamlined task creation and approval interfaces.



Employers: Clear verification tables and proof access.



Tech Recruiters: Polished UI/UX showcasing glassmorphism, neumorphism, and Web3 integration.

2. Design System

Blue (#3B82F6): Primary accents for buttons, icons, headings.



Teal (#2DD4BF): Secondary accents for CTAs, notifications.



Green (#10B981): Success states (e.g., credential earned).



Light Gray (#D1D5DB): Text, borders, secondary elements.



Aurora Gradient: bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 via-teal-500 to-purple-500 for hero, cards, hover states.

2.2 Typography
