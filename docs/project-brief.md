Project Brief: SkillCert
Project Name: SkillCert

Date: August 9, 2025

Author: Analyst (Mary), via BMad Orchestrator
1. Project Overview

Purpose: SkillCert is a decentralized web app enabling freelancers to earn blockchain-verified micro-credentials (e.g., “React Basics”) to prove expertise in the $400B gig economy. It uses a local Ethereum blockchain (Hardhat), IPFS for task proofs, and SQLite for user profiles, with a futuristic UI featuring glassmorphism, neumorphism, micro-interactions, 3D elements, and aurora gradients.
Target Audience:

Freelancers: Earn and share verified credentials to boost hireability.
Educators: Issue credentials via tasks and smart contracts.
Employers: Verify credentials instantly via blockchain.
Tech Recruiters: View portfolio showcasing React, Web3, and modern UI trends.


Value Proposition: Addresses the 60% hiring barrier for freelancers due to unverified skills (LinkedIn, 2025) by providing tamper-proof, globally verifiable credentials, increasing hireability by 30% (Upwork, 2025). The app’s polished UI enhances engagement for portfolio appeal.
Portfolio Goal: Demonstrate expertise in React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Web3 (Solidity, ethers.js, IPFS), and modern UI/UX trends (glassmorphism, neumorphism) for 2025 tech roles.

2. Problem Statement

Problem: 60% of freelancers face hiring barriers due to unverified skills, costing the $400B gig economy $50B annually (LinkedIn, 2025). Traditional certificates are costly and forgeable, and employers lack scalable verification tools.
Impact:

Freelancers struggle to prove expertise.
Employers face risks hiring unverified talent.
Educators need efficient credentialing systems.


Opportunity: A decentralized platform leveraging blockchain and IPFS can provide secure, verifiable credentials with a visually stunning interface to engage users and recruiters.

3. Objectives

Functional:

Enable freelancers to submit tasks and earn micro-credentials recorded on a local Ethereum blockchain.
Allow employers to verify credentials instantly via ethers.js.
Provide educators tools to create tasks and issue credentials.
Visualize skill progress with ApexCharts (aurora gradients).


Non-Functional:

Achieve page load <1s, blockchain queries <2s, SQLite queries <100ms.
Ensure WCAG 2.1 accessibility via shadcn/ui.
Implement security with JWT, bcrypt, and SQLite encryption.


Portfolio:

Showcase glassmorphic cards, neumorphic buttons, 3D badges (Three.js), and micro-interactions (Framer Motion, React-Spring).
Create screencasts for GitHub and LinkedIn (landing page, dashboard, verification flow).



4. Key Features

Task Submission: Freelancers upload tasks (e.g., code projects) to IPFS via glassmorphic forms (React Hook Form, shadcn/ui).
Credential Issuance: Educators approve tasks, issuing 3D badges on blockchain (Solidity, Hardhat).
Credential Verification: Employers query credentials via glassmorphic tables (ethers.js).
Progress Tracking: Visualize skill growth with ApexCharts (aurora gradient fill).
UI/UX: Glassmorphic cards, neumorphic buttons, 3D elements, micro-interactions, aurora gradients.
Settings: Neumorphic forms for user preferences (e.g., skill categories).

5. Market Context

Market Size: $400B gig economy, growing 12% annually (Upwork, 2025).
Competitors: LinkedIn Learning, Coursera (centralized, no blockchain).
Differentiator: Decentralized, tamper-proof credentials with a futuristic UI tailored for portfolio appeal.

6. Success Metrics

Engagement: 80% of demo users complete a task.
Performance: Page load <1s, blockchain queries <2s.
Portfolio: Screencasts showcasing UI trends and Web3 integration on GitHub/LinkedIn.
Market Fit: Address 60% freelancer hiring barrier.
